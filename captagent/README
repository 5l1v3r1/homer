Homer capturing agent.

The agent will duplicate all SIP messages in HEP to the Homer capture server.

At this time, only SIP UDP can be duplicate! Don't use it for TCP/SCTP/TLS SIP mirroring.

IPv6 should works also. :-). If you don't need this, remove -DUSE_IPv6 from CFLAGS.

# How to use:

captagent -p 5060 -s homerserver -n -r 5060-5080


usage: captagent <-mvhn> <-d dev> <-s host> <-p port>
             <-P pid file> <-r port|portrange> <-c config file>
   -h  is help/usage
   -v  is version information
   -m  is don't go into promiscuous mode
   -n  is don't go into background
   -d  is use specified device instead of the pcap default
   -s  is the capture server
   -p  is use specified port of capture server
   -r  is open specified capturing port or portrange instead of the default (5060)
   -P  is open specified pid file instead of the default (/var/run/captagent.pid)
   -f  is the file with specific pcap filter       
   -c  is checkout
   -i  is capture identifity. Must be a 16-bit number
   -H  is HEP protocol version [1|2]. By default we use HEP version 1


#Tipp:
-p the port number where your capture server listen on.
-r normaly it's 5060, but you can use ports range 5060-5090 too.
-s this param can be an IP or FQDN
